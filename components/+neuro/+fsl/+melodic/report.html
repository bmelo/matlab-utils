<b>Analysis methods</b> <br>
Analysis was carried out using Probabilistic Independent Component Analysis [Beckmann 2004] as implemented in 
 MELODIC (Multivariate Exploratory Linear Decomposition into Independent Components) Version 3.14, part of FSL (FMRIB's Software Library, <A HREF="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/">www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</A>).<br>The following data pre-processing was applied to the input data: 
 masking of non-brain voxels; voxel-wise de-meaning of the data;
 normalisation of the voxel-wise variance; <br>
 Pre-processed data were whitened and projected into a 15-dimensional subspace using Principal Component Analysis.  <BR>The whitened observations were decomposed into  sets of vectors which describe signal variation across the temporal domain (time-courses)  and across the spatial domain (maps) by optimising for non-Gaussian spatial source distributions using a fixed-point iteration technique [Hyv&auml;rinen 1999]. 
Estimated Component maps were divided by the standard deviation of the residual noise and thresholded by fitting a mixture model to the histogram of intensity values [Beckmann 2004]. <p>
